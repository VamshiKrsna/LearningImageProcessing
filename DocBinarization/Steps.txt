1. download all dibco dataset files and extract them
2. download the matlap mcr r2016a runtime. 
3. copy paste the following dll files to project root : 
 mclmcrrt9_0.dll 
 libmx.dll 
 mclmcr.dll 
 mclmcrrt9_0.dll 
 mclbase.dll 
4. nice, the dll errors are over, now java errors are popping up. 
5. I will replicate these metrics in python rather than following this exe file...
6. wrote a python script : dibco_metrics.py that mimics the exe file
